# Tailor's Assistant

This is a tool to help with estimating work times as a tailor.

It provides a database with an input form to record data about the tailor's previously made workpieces, and a form to calculate predictions of work time needed for an offer of a future workpiece, based on its list of individual steps of work, with statistics about the time needed for similar steps in the past.

The UI is currently in German only, but documentation is in English.

For detailed documentation, see [the project website](http://metakiki.net/tailors-assistant/).
